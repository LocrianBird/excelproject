# Excel Project
## Made in pure JavaScript

[Press here to look at my Excel Pages](http://excelmyversion.surge.sh)

The Excel App was made as a part of the "JavaScript for Seniors" course. The SPA was built fully on pure JavaScript with its own "React" and "Redux" libraries. The functionality is simplified but still replicates that of the real Excel from Microsoft. Deployed on Surge.
